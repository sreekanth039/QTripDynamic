# QTrip Dynamic

QTrip Dynamic is the enhanced version of QTrip, where static pages are brought to life by integrating with a backend and adding engaging UI features. This project builds upon the learnings from **QTrip Static** and **QTrip Dynamic** modules, leading into the first independent project.
